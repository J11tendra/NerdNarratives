Alone programming is tedious task to do. The constant switch between the keyboard and mouse every few seconds disrupts the flow for developers. What if I tell you You can throw away the mouse and use our magic keyboard to perform the task even better then mouse. This can be done with keyboard shortcuts, you can even customize key bindings.

## Introduction

VS Code, a widely embraced text editor among developers, is on the rise. As its popularity soars, it's worth learning shortcuts that acts a catalyst for productivity. The VS Code documentation has hundreds of shortcuts but we'll focus on the most useful ones in this article.
</br></br>
Let's me take a moment to consider the time saved by avoiding the mouse. Imagine Alok, coding for four hours daily. Each mouse use takes about 10 seconds. If he clicks a hundred times, a daily saving of 16 minutes is possible â€“ just by using keyboard shortcuts.

I have divided this shortcuts into 2 broad categories as follows:-

## Conclusion

Using this shortcuts can be very powerful into your coding journey. However, you will notice its real impact once you get used to these key bindings. Try using these key bindings and build muscle memory.

Customizing the key bindings can be very user-friendly experience. I also use custom keys bindings which make my development experience personalized.

_**Note:** These key bindings are based on the default VS Code settings. You can customize them to your liking within the VS Code settings._
