Welcome to my repository containing all my blog posts published on [DEV](https://dev.to/jitendrachoudhary). Below you'll find a list of my articles along with a brief description.

## Articles

1. **[Stop Contributing To Open Source](https://dev.to/jitendrachoudhary/stop-contributing-to-open-source-13nb)**
   - Open-source projects can be an excellent resource for developers who want to become expert developer. These projects provide real-world, hands-on experience, allowing developers to work on real-world problems and write code. This is crucial for skill development. Working on open-source projects exposes developers to a diverse group, allowing them to learn from experienced programmers, receive feedback on their code, and observe best practices in action.
   - In this article, I will cover the problems faced by open-source maintainers due to beginner developers creating unwanted and annoying pull requests. I will also discuss why beginners choose to contribute to open-source without understanding the purpose of their contribution. Why Open-Source Might Not be the Best Place to Start for Beginners.
2. **[Explaining Open Source To My Doctor](https://dev.to/jitendrachoudhary/explaining-open-source-to-my-doctor-4e5a)**
   - You might be wondering why I'm explaining open source to a doctor. While I was in the hospital for a year, I spent a lot of time reflecting on the potential of technology to make a positive impact. I started wondering how I could explain these concepts to a beginner. I used to imagine conversation with the people around me. This blog post is a result of that curiosity.
