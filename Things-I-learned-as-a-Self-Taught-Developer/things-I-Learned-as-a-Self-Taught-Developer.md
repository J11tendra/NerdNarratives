## Introduction

In this blog Jitendra shares his 10 most important lessons he learned as a self taught developer. So if you in the same boat and your time is worth trying to implement these lessons in your programming life. Through my experience, I've come to learn several crucial lessons that have shaped my approach to coding and career development. In this article, I'll share some insights from my journey as a self-taught developer.

## Fundamentals is the King

Many times you will hear the buzz “know the fundamentals”!! But I used to wonder why. Fundamentals are the building blocks of everything that exists out there. Knowing the fundamentals will help you understand the logic, the principles, and the purpose of what you are learning. Let's understand this with an example: learning the basics of programming is like knowing the alphabet, letters, words, etc., and then choosing which story to write about. The story is like a framework that will trend and flop, but the fundamentals of the language will remain. So, don’t be a React king first; be a JavaScript king.

## Big Tech is not the end of the world

Working at Big Tech may not be the best experience for programmers who are looking for flexibility. Often, in big tech, you will end up working on a specific part of the company’s codebase. Whereas, working at a startup, you can have major control over things and, hence, a greater impact on the company. If you are looking for greater impact and learning and more control over things, big tech might not be the thing for you. Often, working in a startup means you can work on cool, creative projects, and innovation is your thing. Working at Big Tech gets you respect in the tech community and watches your bank account max out.

## Networking is the key

Building a strong network within the tech community is invaluable. Networking opens doors to opportunities, mentorship, and collaboration. Attend meetups, conferences, and online forums to connect with like-minded individuals. Share your knowledge, seek advice, and be open to learning from others. Your network can play a significant role in your career growth and development as a self-taught developer.

## The stack is irrelevant

It's natural to love the tools you use every day, but they're not as important as you might think. New tools are built to solve problems that their predecessors failed to solve. New technology can be a lot of fun, but becoming too attached to it can be harmful. So, be sure to learn about the latest technology, but also remember to use it as a tool, not a crutch. It's foolish to ignore new technology and stick with what you know. Instead, challenge yourself to explore new languages, frameworks, and patterns, because that's how you'll grow and expand your knowledge. Focus on learning because that's what makes work enjoyable.

## Learning is Real

As a self-taught developer, the learning never stops. Embrace a growth mindset and be prepared to continuously update your skills and knowledge. Explore new technologies, languages, and frameworks to stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry. Take online courses, read books, and engage in hands-on projects to deepen your understanding. Remember, learning is a lifelong journey, and staying curious is the key to success.

## Programming-is-Hard

Undoubtedly, programming can be challenging. It requires patience, problem-solving skills, and perseverance. Don't be discouraged by setbacks or failures; instead, view them as opportunities for growth. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one step at a time. Practice regularly, and seek help when needed. With determination and practice, you can overcome any programming challenge.

## Importance of Real-World Experience

While theoretical knowledge is essential, nothing beats real-world experience. Internships, freelance projects, or contributing to open-source initiatives can provide valuable hands-on experience. These opportunities allow you to apply your skills in a practical setting, learn from experienced professionals, and build a portfolio of work. Employers value candidates with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, so don't underestimate the importance of gaining real-world exposure.

## Become a Master of One Trade

Rather than spreading yourself too thin, focus on mastering one programming language or technology stack. Specializing in a specific area allows you to develop deep expertise and differentiate yourself in the job market. Identify your interests and strengths, and invest time and effort into honing your skills in that particular domain. While it's essential to have a broad understanding of various technologies, becoming a master of one trade can open doors to exciting career opportunities.

## Learn How to Collaborate

Collaboration is essential in the world of software development. Learn how to effectively communicate and collaborate with team members, whether they're developers, designers, or stakeholders. Practice agile methodologies, participate in code reviews, and contribute to group projects to enhance your collaborative skills. Being able to work effectively in a team not only improves the quality of your work but also fosters a positive and productive work environment.

## Project-based Learning

Hands-on projects are an excellent way to reinforce your learning and showcase your skills to potential employers. Work on personal projects or contribute to open-source initiatives to apply what you've learned in a real-world context. Projects allow you to experiment with different technologies, solve practical problems, and build a portfolio of work that demonstrates your abilities. Focus on creating projects that align with your interests and career goals, and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone.

## Conclusion

Teaching yourself programming is a journey filled with challenges and opportunities for growth. By implementing this points into your programming journey you can succeed as self taught developer.
